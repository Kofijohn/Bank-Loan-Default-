Methodology
The dataset is made up of simulated from Kaggle with loan acquired from a financial institution, with both the borrower paying 
at the end of the stated period and not paying at the end of the stated period. The total number of loan is 850,
with 183 borrowers not paying at the end of the stated period. 
The dataset contain 12 columns (['age', 'ed', 'employ', 'address', 'income', 'debtinc', 'creddebt', 'othdebt', 'default', 'preddef1', 'preddef2', 'preddef3'])
of which preddef1, preddef2, preddef3, address are irrelevant iin fitting the model. age= age of the borrower

ed=education level of the borrower

employ= number of employment of the borrower

income= income level of the borrower in thousands

debtinc= debt interest calculation

creddebt= actual debt of the borrower

othedebt=other debt of the borrower

default= status of either settled on time or not[0= settled loan on time 1=did not settle loan on time]

#Confusion Matrix Explanation

Confusion matrix is in a form of square which is divided into four segments with the top right corner named FP and top left corner named TN,
left down corner named FN and right down corner named TP.

Positive (P): A positive observation has been made.

Negative (N): indicates that the observation is negative.

True Positive (TP): The observation is positive and will be positive.

False Negative (FN): The observation is positive, but the outcome is expected to be negative.

True Negative (TN): The observation is negative and will be negative.

False Positive (FP): A negative observation is projected to be positive.

Accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct classifications out of the total number of cases.

Accuracy = TP + TN / TP+TN+FP+FN

Remember, it's the percentage of instances with valid positive classifications that are genuinely positive.

Recall = TP/ TP + FN

Precision: It is the proportion of correct positive classification from cases that are predicted as positive.

Precision = TP / TP + FP

we will use logistic regression to fit the model with the help of python programming language, using jupyternote book IDE

And our dataset is imbalace with the imbalace dataset I will use undersampling techique to resolve that.

Undersampling Technique
Undersampling is a technique to balance uneven datasets by keeping all of the data in the minority class and decreasing the size of the majority class.
It is one of several techniques data scientists can use to extract more accurate information from originally imbalanced datasets
